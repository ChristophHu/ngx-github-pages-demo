## Description
This repository is a dummy and demo application built with Angular 19, showcasing the integration with GitHub's API. It displays user information, repositorie, and other relevant data using Angular components and services. The application is styled using SASS and leverages TailwindCSS for utility-first styling.

All my GithubPages will use this dummy application as a template for future projects.

## Installation

npm i @christophhu/ngx-github-pages-demo
